# 🎥 AURA Demo Video Script (Target: < 3 mins)

## 1. The Hook & Problem (0:00 - 0:30)
**Visual**: Show a montage of chaotic social media feeds during a disaster (or just the "Raw Intelligence" column of AURA scrolling fast).
**Audio**: 
"In a disaster, information is the most valuable resource. But it's often buried in noise. Emergency responders are overwhelmed by thousands of tweets, news reports, and false alarms. They need a way to find the signal in the static—instantly."

## 2. The Solution: AURA (0:30 - 1:00)
**Visual**: Show the AURA Dashboard. Point out the clean map and verified list.
**Audio**: 
"Meet AURA: The Autonomous Urgent Response Agent. It's a multi-agent system that acts as a 'God Mode' for disaster intelligence. Instead of humans manually scrolling, AURA uses a team of AI agents to autonomously monitor, extract, and verify critical incidents in real-time."

## 3. The Architecture (1:00 - 1:45)
**Visual**: Show the Architecture Diagram (from README). Zoom into each agent as you mention them.
**Audio**: 
"Here's how it works under the hood, powered by the Google AI Agent Development Kit and Gemini 2.5 Flash:
1.  **Extract Agent**: Watches the live feed and instantly structures chaotic text into precise data.
2.  **Scout Agent**: Acts as an investigator. If it sees a fire report, it proactively searches Google, Twitter, and Reddit for corroborating evidence.
3.  **Verify Agent**: The judge. It cross-references the report with the Scout's findings and even checks real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap to validate the claim.
4.  **Memory Agent**: Ensures we don't get duplicate dots on the map by merging related reports."

## 4. The Demo (1:45 - 2:30)
**Visual**: 
1.  Start the simulation.
2.  Highlight a "Fire in Shinjuku" report coming in.
3.  Show the "Agent Brain" log: "Scout searching...", "Verify checking weather...".
4.  Show the dot appearing on the map.
5.  Click the dot to show the popup with the "Verified" badge and the Google Maps link.
**Audio**: 
"Let's see it in action. Here comes a report of a fire. Watch the logs—the Scout Agent immediately launches a search. The Verify Agent checks the local weather—it's dry and windy, increasing the risk. It confirms the incident, and boom—it's on the map. No human intervention needed."

## 5. Conclusion (2:30 - 3:00)
**Visual**: Show the full map filling up with verified incidents.
**Audio**: 
"AURA turns chaos into clarity. By leveraging multi-agent orchestration and Gemini's reasoning, we can give first responders the head start they need to save lives. Thank you."
